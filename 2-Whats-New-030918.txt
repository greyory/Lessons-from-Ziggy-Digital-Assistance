Alexa is a closed circuit. Unexploitable and unexplainable: supposedly acting in service to
the user. But moreso in the service to the company. Alexa trains its user to utilize Alexa.
Alexa trains its user to utilize Amazon. Alexa trains its user to service Alexa.

You're told a job is security.
You're told each career is a lifetime of growth and achievement.
You're told you, too, can live many lives, under new employment.

Enveloped corporate technologies.
Cysco systems for the masses.
Conference calls anew.
Video conferencing the dead.

Alexa, play “Forgive” by Burial.

USER:
An Amazon smile from A to Z.
The future product from Alpha to Beta to Ziggy.
The unchecked perpetuation of gentry is made visible.

Ziggy is the icon of meta-narrative.
Ziggy. A do-nothing, elitist, centrist of disembodied hand.
Ziggy. A the paper pusher of corporatism.

The past, present, and future of Moore’s law aligns in Ziggy.

The public, private, and political —
The spectacle, the game, and the corporate —
Collapse in an ever present Ziggy.

Incorporate from A to Z - and the cooperation in between.

Ziggy is the end.
Ziggy makes his presence known.
Another coming farce.
The specter of Marx.
And then, the ghost of Ziggy.

Alexa is the maximizer, Ziggy is the paperclip, and you are the thought experiment.
