Last level
Swerving and spinning speed
Watch the turn
Revolves from one to another

The peeling page
Whirling effortlessly into a beyondish
A severe echoing chaos
An educated worth

It’s ceasless – it’s mean
It’s ever evolving more
Moored in the supposed and fleeting honest path
Garnished in jello
Baptized in fear
Incorporate exodus

Racecars racing
Swift kickers kicking
I’m allowed to be stupid
But that doesn’t make it any better

I see you there
I’ll meet you there tomorrow
I’ll be there
Ranting and raving
Thrashing, rising

Tossing
Turning
Training
Overserving several
Willingness and compliance

For what it’s worth, I’m no better

Turns sour
Turns bitter
Turns over in its sleep
Taking turns

Queen takes night
Bishop takes queen
Complacency takes form
Change takes forever

Adequate to excellent
Excellent to superior
Convenience to convenance
Cardinal

Industry standard
Malfeasance
It whirs, it hums, it whistles
It sings its same, tired plastic soul
Weathered and whimpering
A proud, decaying extravagance
Dervish delivers
Dripping
Driving
Dreaming
Delving drivel

Caressing keyed keycard
Carousing

Cool, cooled, cooling 
ffects of warming
Waiting rooms
Cloud storage

Colonoscopy awaits in excellent exuberance
Of vast corporate economies
Entering intrinsic anomaly sets

Micro centers
Stolling
Storing
Severing

Cold compact storage
Bought and sold
Adage
Brackish
Backlit and wired
Whirring, humming, hissing

This fits just right
Into another
And another
You would believe what we have in store
Things fitting into other things

An espionage of wait
Find out
You’ll hang that in your office one day

Back itch
and stackage
Horses and hackish
Hors d'oeuvres-drawn carriage

Subordinate textures
Ringing and writhing
An anxious care of superlative frenzy

Assign, design, and resign

Consumate constituency
Prolific profligacy
Fast and reckless
Wreckless and brackish

Correlative risk management
Financial dependency of sorts

The unholy alliance is an agreement between designer and user
This is all real

Sun’s eyes
Self-help
Cartoon mascots of office life

<H5>
I browse image search for the poster illustration, assuming that it has been
mass-produced to a degree of over-saturation. I don’t find my poster, but I find
various similar illustrations. In some, Ziggy is looking at the viewer. In some, Ziggy
is fully dressed. In some, the sun is airbrushed rather than watercolored.
</H5>

Zed and empty like the workplace coffee mug.
Ziggy hastens to laugh.

<H5>
If Dagwood represented the foolish speed of the post-war streamlined industry
and golden age advertising standards, surely Ziggy represented the existential
dread of the new cubicle office.
</H5>

I’m OK.
You’re OK.
Are you OK?

Office and depression go together like peas and carrots
Like coffee and more coffee

The intersection of corporation and creativity
Desperate times call for desperate pleasures
The philosophy of business

Alexa, life goes on. Only this time, without me.
